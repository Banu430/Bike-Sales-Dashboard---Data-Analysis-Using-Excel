🔍 Bike Sales Data Analysis using Microsoft Excel

Excited to share my latest project — Bike Sales Data Analysis, where I explored and visualized real-world sales data to uncover key insights and trends! 📊

✅ Key Steps:

Cleaned and organized raw sales data using Excel functions and filters

Applied pivot tables and charts to analyze customer demographics, income vs. purchase trends, and commuting patterns

Built an interactive dashboard to visualize sales performance and highlight buying behavior

💡 Key Insights:

Higher income groups were more likely to purchase bikes

Urban commuters showed stronger purchase intent compared to rural regions

Gender and age also played noticeable roles in sales distribution

This project helped me strengthen my data visualization, analytical thinking, and dashboard design skills in Excel.
